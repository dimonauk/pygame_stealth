DarkCat
v1.0 (02/04/16)

Created by Luc Talatinian, Winter 2016.

Overview:

Control the nimble DarkCat as he slips through the shadows to avoid the many guard dogs between him and his destination. The game is played in a series of levels, with the goal of each level to reach the bottom right-hand corner of the screen without getting caught.

Controls:
The arrow keys control DarkCat in the expected fashion.

Guards:
Your enemies are the guard dogs patrolling on each level. If you are spotted, the dogs will sound the alarm, and the level will restart after a brief cooldown. The guard dogs have extremely sharp (albeit narrow-set) vision: a guard dog will be able to spot you at any distance across the map in a 90-degree cone of vision. Every dog will patrol back and forth between two fixed points across a diagonal line. You can tell which way a dog is currently facing based on its sprite orientation.

There is no way to knockout or disable the guard dogs - to avoid detection, you must move when their backs are turned, and use shadows to stay concealed (see below).

Shadows & Visibility:
Shadows are your friends. While inside a shadow, you are invisible to the guard dogs. You are so well-concealed that a dog passing right next to you in the shadows will NOT notice you. Your level of visibility is shown clearly by the indicator at the bottom of the screen - a red light means that you are out in the open and liable to be discovered, while green means that you are concealed.

I've taken the Cat Fighter, named him Neko (Japanese for 'Cat') and recreated    him in the Jason-Em Classic Hero Style, he'll be making a appearance in Sprinter  Quest on Android too:

Thanks to dogchicken and Jason-Em for the fabulous character designs.

I'm looking around for more characters that can easily be converted into the   Jason-Em style, and keep an eye on DezrasDragons for the more complicated,       unique and better quality ones.
